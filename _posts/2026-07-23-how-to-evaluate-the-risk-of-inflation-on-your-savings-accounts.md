> **Short answer:** Your savings grows in real terms only when its APY, after tax, beats the inflation rate you personally face. Use `(1 + APY) ÷ (1 + inflation) − 1` instead of plain subtraction, take tax out before you deflate, and check the gap once a quarter. A negative real return is not automatically a reason to move money — some balances are supposed to lose a little purchasing power in exchange for being spendable tomorrow morning.

A savings statement only shows one direction: the balance goes up. That is the number the bank owes you, not the number of groceries, rent payments, or plane tickets that balance can buy. The gap between those two is the whole subject of this article. Below is the arithmetic, the places the arithmetic misleads you, the decisions that actually change your outcome, and a quarterly review short enough that you will actually run it.

## Nominal APY vs Real Return, and the Formula That Applies

The APY printed on your account is a **nominal** figure. Under the Truth in Savings rules (12 CFR Part 1030), banks have to quote deposit yields on a uniform annual-percentage-yield basis so you can line up two offers without doing conversion math yourself. That standardization is genuinely useful — but it standardizes only the dollars. It says nothing about what those dollars will buy when you withdraw them.

**Real return** is what is left after prices move. Most articles hand you this:

```
Real return ≈ Nominal APY − Inflation rate
```

That approximation is fine for a napkin. The exact version is:

```
Real return = (1 + Nominal APY) ÷ (1 + Inflation rate) − 1
```

Work an example with numbers you supply yourself. Suppose your account pays 4.00% APY and prices over the same twelve months rise 3.00%. Subtraction says you gained 1.00%. The exact formula says:

- 1.04 ÷ 1.03 = 1.009708...
- minus 1 = **0.9708%**

The difference here is about 3 basis points — irrelevant on a small balance, noticeable on a large one, and much larger when both numbers are big. The approximation always overstates your gain, and it overstates it more as inflation climbs.

## Why Simply Subtracting CPI Is a Rough Cut

Even the exact formula is only as good as the two inputs, and both inputs are shakier than they look.

**The published index is a national average basket.** The Consumer Price Index tracks a weighted basket meant to represent urban consumers as a group. Your basket is not that basket. If you rent in an expensive metro and drive very little, housing and fuel carry completely different weights for you than they do in the national figure.

**CPI is backward-looking; your APY is forward-looking.** The index you read this month describes prices that have already moved. The APY on a variable account describes what the bank intends to pay going forward, and it can change before the next index release. Comparing the two is always slightly out of phase.

**Tax comes out of the nominal number, not the real one.** The IRS treats bank interest as ordinary income in the year it is credited (see [IRS Topic No. 403](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403)). You are taxed on the full nominal interest even in a year when your real return was negative. That is the quiet part of inflation risk: you can lose purchasing power and still owe tax on the loss-making gain. The mechanics of that, including 1099-INT timing and after-tax APY by bracket, are covered in [Taxes on Savings Interest](/2026/07/23/how-tax-implications-affect-your-earnings-from-high-yield-options/).

**Your balance is not static.** The formula assumes one deposit sitting still for a year. Money added in month eight earned partial-year interest against a full year of price changes.

None of this makes the calculation useless. It means the output is a range, not a verdict, and small negative results sit inside the noise.

## Running Your Own Number in Three Steps

Do it in this order — nominal, then tax, then inflation. Reversing the last two produces a flattering answer that is wrong.

**Step 1 — Nominal growth.** Take the APY the bank actually paid you, not the one advertised on the landing page. If you are unsure what your account credited, divide the interest posted over twelve months by your average balance across the same period.

**Step 2 — Subtract tax.** Multiply by (1 − your marginal rate, federal plus state where applicable). Interest sitting inside a tax-deferred account skips this step.

**Step 3 — Deflate.** Apply the exact formula using the inflation figure you decided to use — either the published index or the personal rate built later in this article.

Here is the sequence with assumed inputs. Every number below is a hypothetical you should replace with your own.

| Step | Assumed input | Running result on a $25,000 balance |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal APY paid | 4.00% | $1,000.00 interest |
| Marginal tax rate | 24% federal + 5% state = 29% | $710.00 kept |
| After-tax APY | 4.00% × (1 − 0.29) | 2.84% |
| Assumed inflation | 3.00% | — |
| Real, after-tax return | (1.0284 ÷ 1.03) − 1 | **−0.155%** |
| Purchasing power change | −0.155% × $25,000 | about **−$39** for the year |

That is the shape of the problem in a single table. A headline APY that comfortably beats inflation can still land slightly underwater once tax is applied. Note also how much of the outcome is set by the tax line rather than by the rate you shopped for.

If the difference between rate and APY, or between daily and monthly compounding, is still fuzzy, the full breakdown lives in [APY, Compounding, and What Your Savings Will Really Earn](/2026/07/04/understanding-apy-what-it-means-for-your-savings-strategy/).

## The Trapped-Rate Problem: Locked CDs When Inflation Rises

A certificate of deposit fixes your nominal rate for the term. That is protection when prices cool and a trap when they heat up: your yield cannot move, but the cost of everything you plan to buy can.

The mistake is treating this as permanent. It is not — it is priced. Breaking a CD costs a disclosed early-withdrawal penalty, usually written as a number of days of interest rather than a percentage of principal. So the real question is arithmetic, not regret:

1. Estimate the interest you will still earn by holding to maturity at the locked rate.
2. Estimate the interest a replacement account would pay over those same remaining days.
3. Subtract the penalty from the replacement figure.
4. Move only if step 3 still wins by a margin worth the paperwork.

Two structural points matter more than the market view. First, a penalty can reach into principal when a CD is broken early in its term, because the interest earned so far may be smaller than the days of interest the penalty demands. Second, the deposit curve is not always upward sloping — sometimes shorter terms carry the better rate, which removes much of the reward for locking long. Choosing a term against that backdrop is its own decision, walked through in [Short-Term vs Long-Term CD](/2026/06/08/should-you-opt-for-a-short-term-or-long-term-cd/).

The structural answer to trapped-rate risk is a ladder rather than a forecast. When a portion of your money matures every few months, rising prices reach a repricing opportunity soon, and falling rates only affect one rung at a time. The construction details are in [CD Laddering](/2026/07/09/what-you-need-to-know-about-laddering-certificates-of-deposit/).

## The Other Direction: Variable Accounts When Inflation Falls

High-yield savings and money market accounts reprice at the bank's discretion, and deposit contracts say so plainly. Savers usually read that as pure downside. It is not.

When price growth slows, banks generally cut deposit yields — but a falling APY and an improving real return can happen at the same time, because the denominator in the formula is falling too. An account paying less than it did last year can still be buying you more.

This is where rate-chasing does its damage. Moving money because a headline number dropped, without checking the gap between that number and inflation, often means several days of funds in transit, a new relationship-requirement to satisfy, and a rate that gets trimmed weeks later anyway. Two references keep the decision honest: the [FDIC's monthly national deposit rates](https://www.fdic.gov/national-rates-and-rate-caps), which tells you whether your account has quietly drifted below average, and the [Federal Reserve's monetary policy page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm), which tells you the direction of the policy rate that eventually feeds deposit pricing. Neither one will tell you what your bank will do next week; both will stop you from reacting to a number with no baseline attached.

## Which Balances Should Accept a Negative Real Return

Not every dollar is supposed to win against inflation. Some dollars are buying availability, and availability has a price.

| Money bucket | When you will need it | Acceptable real return | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Emergency reserve | Unknown, possibly tomorrow | Slightly negative is fine | Same-day access is the product you are paying for |
| Insurance deductible set-aside | Unknown, event-driven | Slightly negative is fine | Must be intact on the day a claim happens |
| Known bill inside 12 months | Dated | Near zero | Principal certainty outranks yield over a short window |
| Down payment in 1–3 years | Dated | Aim for positive after tax | Long enough to shop rates and terms, too short for market risk |
| Long-horizon savings, 5+ years | Undated | Deposits alone are the wrong tool | A persistent negative real return compounds against you |

The dividing line is the horizon, not the amount. Below roughly one to two years, the risk of needing the money at a bad moment outweighs the erosion. Beyond five years, accepting a negative real return year after year is a decision with real consequences, and the answer is usually a different instrument rather than a better deposit account.

## Beyond Deposits: How Other Cash Instruments Treat Inflation

If you conclude that part of your balance should not sit in a fixed-rate deposit, these are the mainstream alternatives that still avoid equity risk. Rates on all of them move, so verify current terms at the source rather than trusting any article's numbers.

| Instrument | How it handles inflation | Access | Federal / state tax | Verify at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Savings or money market account | Rate floats at the bank's discretion; may lag price moves in both directions | Immediate to a few business days | Taxable federal and state | Your account's rate sheet; [FDIC national rates](https://www.fdic.gov/national-rates-and-rate-caps) |
| Fixed-rate CD | No adjustment; locked until maturity | Penalty to exit early | Taxable federal and state | Bank disclosure |
| Treasury bills | Reprice at each short maturity, so new inflation shows up quickly | Held to maturity or sold in the market | Federal only; exempt from state and local | [TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) |
| TIPS | Principal adjusts with the published index | Held to maturity or sold in the market | Federal only; inflation adjustments taxed annually | [TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) |
| Series I savings bonds | Composite rate combines a fixed component with an inflation component, reset twice a year | Minimum holding period, plus interest forfeiture if redeemed inside the early window | Federal only; deferrable until redemption | [TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) |

Two things this table is telling you. The state-tax exemption on Treasury instruments changes the after-tax comparison in high-tax states, sometimes enough to flip the ranking. And the products that adjust with inflation ask for something in return — a holding period, an annual purchase cap, or price movement if you sell before maturity. There is no instrument that pays a real return, settles same day, and carries no lock-up.

## Building a Personal Inflation Rate From Your Own Spending

The national index is a starting point. Your own rate is more useful and takes about twenty minutes to construct.

1. **Pull twelve months of spending** from one or two accounts and sort it into six to eight categories: housing, food at home, dining out, transportation, insurance and healthcare, utilities and phone, everything else.
2. **Convert each category to a weight.** Category total ÷ annual total. The weights must sum to 1.
3. **Find the price change for each category.** The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes CPI by category alongside the headline number, so you can pull a rate for food, shelter, energy, and medical care separately rather than using one blended figure.
4. **Multiply and add.** Weight × category price change, summed across all categories, gives your personal rate.
5. **Sanity-check against your own bills.** Compare it to what your rent, premium, and grocery totals actually did. If your personal rate says 3% and your fixed costs rose far more, your category weights are probably wrong.

A worked shape, with assumed weights and assumed category changes purely to show the mechanics:

| Category | Assumed weight | Assumed price change | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Housing | 0.35 | 4.0% | 1.40% |
| Food | 0.15 | 3.0% | 0.45% |
| Transportation | 0.15 | 2.0% | 0.30% |
| Insurance & healthcare | 0.10 | 5.0% | 0.50% |
| Utilities & phone | 0.08 | 1.0% | 0.08% |
| Everything else | 0.17 | 2.0% | 0.34% |
| **Personal rate** | **1.00** | — | **3.07%** |

Renters and homeowners with fixed mortgages usually land on very different numbers here, which is exactly the point. A household whose largest line item is frozen by contract faces a lower effective rate than the headline suggests, and can rationally accept a lower APY.

## Reviewing the Gap Once a Quarter

Fifteen minutes, four times a year, using the same worksheet each time:

- **Read the actual APY your accounts paid**, from the statement, not the marketing page. Interest posted ÷ average balance.
- **Compare each account to the national average** using the FDIC's monthly publication. Below average with no compensating feature is a flag, not an emergency.
- **Recompute after-tax APY** if your bracket or state changed.
- **Deflate** using your personal rate or the headline index — but use the same one every quarter so the trend means something.
- **Check whether any CD is inside its grace period.** A maturing certificate that auto-renews into a low rate is a bigger leak than a fractional APY difference.
- **Decide once, in writing.** Stay, split, or move — and if you move, note the reason so next quarter's review can tell whether it worked.

If a review keeps producing "move," the problem is probably account selection rather than inflation. The checklist for that is in [High-Yield Savings Accounts: What to Check Before Opening](/2026/06/15/what-to-consider-when-opening-a-high-yield-savings-account/), and the [CFPB's guide to bank accounts](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/bank-accounts/) covers the disclosure documents you should be reading before signing anything.

## Inflation and Savings: Questions Worth Asking

**Can I lose money in a savings account because of inflation?**
Your nominal balance does not fall — insured deposits return principal plus credited interest. What falls is what that balance buys. A negative real return is a loss in purchasing power, and it does not appear anywhere on your statement.

**Is a negative real return a reason to move to investments?**
Only for money you will not need soon. Moving an emergency reserve into market-priced assets to chase a positive real return trades a small, predictable erosion for the possibility of a large loss on the exact day you need the cash.

**Should I use the headline CPI or my own rate?**
Use the headline number for comparing accounts and your personal rate for deciding how much erosion you can tolerate. Do not switch between them from quarter to quarter — the change in method will swamp the change in reality.

**Do CDs protect against inflation at all?**
A CD protects against a *falling* rate environment by locking a yield in place. Against rising prices it does the opposite. Short terms and ladders are the deposit-side answers; index-linked Treasury instruments are the structural one.

Run the three-step calculation on your largest cash balance this week. If the result is positive after tax, you are done until next quarter. If it is negative, the next question is not "which bank" but "does this money belong in a deposit at all" — and that has a different answer for an emergency reserve than for savings you will not touch for a decade.
