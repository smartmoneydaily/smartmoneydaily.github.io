> **Short answer:** Interest from savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs is ordinary income, taxed at your marginal rate in the year the bank credits it or makes it available to you. The number that matters for planning is not the advertised APY but the APY multiplied by one minus your combined federal and state marginal rate.

Every rate comparison you make is a pre-tax comparison. The bank quotes a gross APY, the aggregator ranks gross APYs, and none of that survives contact with your tax return. Two accounts paying the same rate can leave you with different amounts, because one is a Treasury-backed instrument your state cannot tax and the other is a bank deposit it can.

This page covers the mechanics: what gets taxed and when, which form reports it, the one deduction savers routinely miss, and how to convert an advertised rate into the rate you keep.

## Interest Is Ordinary Income, and That Sets Everything Else

Bank interest is taxed as ordinary income. It is stacked on top of your wages and taxed at your marginal rate — the rate on your last dollar of income, not your average rate. There is no preferential long-term capital gains treatment for deposit interest no matter how long you leave the money alone.

Three consequences follow, and they explain most of what savers get wrong:

- **Your principal is never taxed.** Only the interest is income. Moving $40,000 between banks is not a taxable event.
- **The tax is due for the year the interest is credited**, whether or not you spend it, transfer it, or even look at it. Leaving interest to compound inside the account does not defer anything.
- **Your marginal rate, not your bracket label, does the work.** A large interest payment can push part of your income into the next bracket, so only the portion above the threshold is taxed at the higher rate. The IRS publishes the current rate schedule and thresholds each year; look up your own numbers rather than assuming last year's still apply.

## What Form 1099-INT Actually Tells You

Banks report your interest to you and to the IRS on Form 1099-INT, generally sent early in the year for the prior tax year. Most savers glance at the total and file it. The boxes below the total are where the useful information is.

| Box | What it reports | Why it matters to you |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Interest income | Gross interest credited — the figure that flows to your return, before any penalty offset |
| 2 | Early withdrawal penalty | The CD penalty you paid; this is deductible and does **not** reduce Box 1 |
| 3 | Interest on U.S. Savings Bonds and Treasury obligations | Federally taxable, but generally exempt from state and local income tax |
| 4 | Federal income tax withheld | Non-zero only if backup withholding applied to your account |
| 8 | Tax-exempt interest | Reportable but generally not federally taxable |

Two practical notes. Box numbering has shifted across form revisions, so confirm the layout against the current year's form on [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-int) rather than a printout you saved. And a 1099-INT is issued once your interest at that institution passes the reporting threshold in the form instructions — a low, fixed dollar figure, not a tax-free allowance.

That last point is the single most common misunderstanding. **Interest is taxable from the first dollar.** If three banks each pay you a small amount and none of them crosses the reporting threshold, none of them has to mail you a form, and you still owe tax on all of it. The threshold governs the bank's paperwork, not your liability. This is exactly why savers who spread balances across five institutions chasing rates end up under-reporting: no form arrived, so nothing got entered.

## When CD Interest Is Taxed: Credited, Available, or Deferred

The blunt version circulating online is that CD interest is "taxed as it accrues, not at maturity." That is right for some CDs and wrong for others, and the difference is worth getting straight because it decides which year the income lands in.

The governing idea is availability. You report interest when you receive it or when you could receive it without paying a substantial penalty. Applied to real products:

- **Terms of one year or less that pay everything at maturity.** The interest is generally reported in the year it is paid — the maturity year — because you had no access to it before then.
- **CDs that credit interest at intervals of a year or less over a multi-year term.** Each year's credited interest is reported in that year, even though the money sits inside the CD and you never touched it.
- **CDs where interest is deferred for more than one year** (zero-coupon style, or a long CD that pays a single lump at the end). These fall under the original issue discount rules, and a portion is reported annually as it accrues, usually on Form 1099-OID rather than a 1099-INT.

The last category is the trap. A five-year CD structured to pay everything at the end can generate taxable income in years one through four with no cash arriving to pay the tax. IRS [Publication 550](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550) sets out these rules and the OID treatment; read the CD's disclosure alongside it before you assume the tax bill arrives with the money.

Brokered CDs sit in their own category. They live in a brokerage account and show up on a consolidated year-end statement. There is no early withdrawal penalty on a brokered CD because there is no early withdrawal — you sell it on the secondary market, and the result is a capital gain or loss rather than a deductible penalty, with accrued interest handled separately at settlement. If a brokered CD is called before maturity, the interest simply stops.

## The Early-Withdrawal Penalty Deduction Most People Miss

Break a CD and the bank hands back your money minus a penalty, usually stated as a number of days of interest. Two things happen on the tax side, and only one of them is intuitive.

First, the bank still reports the full gross interest in Box 1. It does not net the penalty out. Second, the penalty appears separately in Box 2, and it is an adjustment to income on Schedule 1 of Form 1040, on the line labeled "Penalty on early withdrawal of savings."

That placement matters: it is an above-the-line adjustment, so you claim it even if you take the standard deduction. Anyone who assumes deductions require itemizing leaves this on the table.

Worked example, with assumed figures. Suppose you hold a 3-year CD of $20,000 paying 4.00% APY and break it after 14 months, and the disclosure sets the penalty at 180 days of simple interest.

- Interest credited before you broke it: roughly $20,000 × 4.00% × (14/12) ≈ $933
- Penalty: $20,000 × 4.00% × (180/365) ≈ $394
- Box 1 shows about $933; Box 2 shows about $394
- Net taxable effect: roughly $539 of income after the Schedule 1 adjustment

Note that the two amounts are calculated on different bases — the credited interest reflects your actual holding period, the penalty reflects a fixed number of days. That is why a penalty can exceed the interest you have earned on a CD broken early in its term, which is how a penalty reaches into principal. The mechanics of that, including how to run the break-even before you decide, are covered in [what cashing out a CD early actually costs](/2026/05/25/what-happens-when-you-cash-out-a-cd-early/).

## State Tax: Where Treasuries and Municipal Funds Break the Pattern

Federal treatment is uniform. State treatment is not, and it is where a meaningful rate difference hides.

Bank deposit interest — savings, money market accounts, CDs — is generally taxable by your state if your state taxes income at all. Interest on U.S. Treasury obligations is exempt from state and local income tax by federal statute, which is why Box 3 exists as a separate line. Government money market funds pass through some portion of that character to shareholders; the fund publishes the percentage after year-end. Municipal funds work in the other direction: often federally exempt, with state treatment depending on where the issuers are.

You can turn this into a number instead of a vibe. Assume a federal marginal rate of 24% and a state rate of 6%. A Treasury paying 4.00% keeps 4.00% × (1 − 0.24) = 3.04% after tax. For a bank CD to match that, it must clear 3.04% ÷ (1 − 0.30) ≈ **4.34%**. So in that scenario a CD needs roughly 34 basis points of headline advantage just to tie. In a state with no income tax, the gap disappears entirely and the comparison goes back to the raw APYs.

Run that arithmetic with your own rates before concluding a CD beats a Treasury. Rules for individual securities are on [treasurydirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/), and fund-level pass-through percentages come from the fund company's year-end tax documents — the same documents worth checking when you are [evaluating a money market fund](/2026/06/25/a-comprehensive-guide-to-finding-the-right-money-market-fund/).

One naming point that trips people up: money market **funds** distribute dividends, not interest, and report on Form 1099-DIV. Money market **accounts** at a bank pay interest and report on Form 1099-INT. Same-sounding products, different forms, different insurance.

## Working Out the APY You Actually Keep

The conversion is one line:

**After-tax APY = APY × (1 − combined marginal rate)**

Combined marginal rate means federal plus state on your last dollar. It is an approximation — state tax interacts with your federal deduction — but it is close enough to rank accounts, which is all you need it for.

There is a [after-tax and inflation-adjusted return calculator](/tools/after-tax-real-return-calculator/) on this site if you want to put your own numbers through it.

Here is the same conversion laid out. Every figure assumes a 4.00% APY on a $25,000 balance held for a full year — substitute your own quote and rate.

| Assumed combined marginal rate | After-tax APY | Annual interest kept on $25,000 |
|---|---|---|
| 0% (tax-deferred account) | 4.00% | $1,000 |
| 10% | 3.60% | $900 |
| 20% | 3.20% | $800 |
| 25% | 3.00% | $750 |
| 30% | 2.80% | $700 |
| 35% | 2.60% | $650 |
| 40% | 2.40% | $600 |

Two readings of that table are useful. The first: the spread between the best and worst rate you were shopping is often smaller than the spread taxes create, so an hour spent confirming account structure usually beats an hour spent chasing 10 basis points. The second: after-tax is still not the end of the line. Subtract inflation and you get the real return, which is the only figure that tells you whether your purchasing power grew — the method for that is in [what inflation does to your savings APY](/2026/07/23/how-to-evaluate-the-risk-of-inflation-on-your-savings-accounts/). If you want to double-check the gross figure the calculator produces, the compounding math behind it is broken down in [how APY and compounding actually work](/2026/07/04/understanding-apy-what-it-means-for-your-savings-strategy/).

## Tax-Advantaged Places to Hold Cash, and Their Limits

Moving cash into a sheltered account removes the annual tax drag, and every one of these comes with a constraint that makes it wrong for some balances.

| Where the cash sits | Tax treatment of interest | The constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Taxable bank account or CD | Taxed annually at ordinary rates | None — full liquidity, full tax |
| CD or savings inside a Traditional IRA | Deferred until distribution | Annual contribution limit; distribution rules and potential early-distribution penalties |
| CD or savings inside a Roth IRA | No tax on qualified distributions | Contribution limit plus income eligibility rules; withdrawal ordering rules apply |
| Cash inside an HSA | Deferred, and tax-free for qualified medical costs | Requires a qualifying high-deductible health plan; limited purpose |
| Treasury securities held directly | Federally taxable, state-exempt | Not a bank deposit; sold at market value before maturity |

Contribution limits and eligibility thresholds are adjusted periodically, so pull the current figures from irs.gov rather than repeating a number you read somewhere. And keep the obvious in view: an emergency fund does not belong inside a retirement account no matter how good the tax treatment is. Shelter long-horizon cash, leave short-horizon cash where you can reach it.

## Records, Joint Accounts, and Withholding

A few operational details that generate letters from the IRS more often than they should:

- **Reconcile every 1099-INT against your own records** before filing. Compare the form's Box 1 to the year-to-date interest on your December statement. Mismatches usually trace to a promotional bonus, which banks typically report as interest rather than as a rebate.
- **Missing forms do not mean missing income.** If an institution never sent one, add the interest from your December statement anyway.
- **Joint accounts report under one Social Security number.** If the reported interest is not all yours — a joint account with an adult child, for instance — the IRS provides a nominee reporting procedure so the income lands on the right return. Sorting this out is far easier than unwinding it after a notice arrives.
- **Backup withholding** applies when the institution does not have a correct taxpayer identification number on file, at a flat rate set by statute. It shows up in Box 4. If you ever see a non-zero Box 4 unexpectedly, fix your W-9 with that bank.
- **Schedule B** becomes required once your total interest and ordinary dividends exceed the threshold printed in the form instructions, and it also asks about foreign accounts. Check the current instructions; the threshold and the questions both change.

Keep 1099s, December statements, and CD disclosures together for as long as your records retention rule requires. If a bank ever restates a form, having the original statement is what settles the argument. General consumer-facing explanations of account disclosures are available from the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) if a bank's own paperwork is unclear.

## Tax Questions That Come Up at Filing Time

**Can I avoid tax by leaving the interest in the account?** No. Credited interest is income whether or not you withdraw it. Compounding changes your balance, not your tax year.

**My CD does not mature until next year. Do I owe anything now?** Depends on the structure. A one-year CD paying at maturity is generally reported in the maturity year. A multi-year CD that credits interest annually is reported each year, and a long CD deferring all interest for more than a year falls under the OID rules and accrues annually. Check the disclosure.

**Does breaking a CD lower my tax bill?** It lowers your taxable amount, but through Box 2 and the Schedule 1 adjustment, not by reducing the reported interest in Box 1. The penalty is still a real loss — the deduction only refunds it at your marginal rate.

**Are account fees deductible against the interest?** Generally no for personal accounts. Fees reduce what you keep without reducing what you are taxed on, which makes fee avoidance worth more per dollar than rate chasing.

**Should I have taxes withheld from interest?** Deposit interest is normally paid gross. If interest income is large enough to create an underpayment, adjust withholding on your paycheck or make estimated payments rather than waiting for April.

The practical routine is short: convert every advertised APY into an after-tax APY before comparing, check Box 2 whenever you break a CD, verify whether the account is state-taxable, and reconcile each 1099-INT against your December statement. Nothing here requires a tax professional, but the multi-year CD timing question and anything involving nominee reporting are worth one call before you file rather than one letter after.
