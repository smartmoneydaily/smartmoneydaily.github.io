![Five CD rungs maturing one year apart, with each matured rung rolling back into a new long-term CD at the top of the ladder](/assets/pin-images/2026-07-09-what-you-need-to-know-about-laddering-certificates-of-deposit.png)

> **Short answer:** Split your deposit into equal rungs that mature one year apart, then roll every maturing rung into a new long-term CD. You get access to a slice of the money each year without paying a penalty, and after the first cycle every rung is earning a long-term rate. The trade-off is that during the first few years the ladder earns less than one long CD, and it always earns less if rates fall.

A CD ladder is not a product you buy. It is a schedule you keep. You divide one deposit into several CDs that mature at spaced intervals, and each time one matures you decide whether to spend it or roll it into a new long-term CD. Once the cycle repeats itself, you hold nothing but long-term CDs and yet something matures every year.

That is the entire idea. What follows is how to build it with real arithmetic, when it pays, and the specific ways ladders fall apart in practice.

## What a Ladder Actually Solves

CDs force a single decision: how long will you leave this money alone? Choose a short term and you keep flexibility but usually accept a lower rate. Choose a five-year term and you lock the rate, but the money is behind a penalty wall until maturity.

A ladder refuses to answer that question with one number. Instead of committing all the cash to one date, you commit portions of it to several dates. The result is a portfolio where the average maturity is long but the nearest maturity is close.

Two things follow from that structure:

- **You stop guessing the top of the rate cycle.** If rates rise after you build the ladder, the next rung matures within a year and gets reinvested at the new level. You are never fully locked into an old quote for five years.
- **You stop paying penalties for ordinary life.** Most savers who break a CD do it because they mis-sized the term, not because of a disaster. A ladder gives you a scheduled exit so you rarely need an unscheduled one. If you do end up needing one, the cost is worth understanding first — see [what cashing out a CD early actually costs](/2026/05/25/what-happens-when-you-cash-out-a-cd-early/).

What a ladder does not do is manufacture yield. It is a liquidity structure with a yield side effect, and that distinction decides most of the arguments people have about it.

## The Classic Five-Rung Ladder, Built Out

Take $25,000 and open five CDs of $5,000 each, maturing at one through five years.

Rates in this section are **assumptions used to show the arithmetic**, not quotes. Suppose the bank posts 4.00% APY at one year, 3.85% at two, 3.75% at three, 3.70% at four, and 3.80% at five, with annual compounding. Look up your own bank's rate sheet and the [FDIC's national deposit rate data](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/) before you assume anything close to these.

| Rung | Deposit | Term | Assumed APY | Value at that rung's maturity | Interest |
|------|---------|------|-------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| 1 | $5,000 | 1 year | 4.00% | $5,200.00 | $200.00 |
| 2 | $5,000 | 2 years | 3.85% | $5,392.41 | $392.41 |
| 3 | $5,000 | 3 years | 3.75% | $5,583.86 | $583.86 |
| 4 | $5,000 | 4 years | 3.70% | $5,782.09 | $782.09 |
| 5 | $5,000 | 5 years | 3.80% | $6,025.00 | $1,025.00 |

Each figure is principal × (1 + APY)^years. Rung 3, for example, is 5,000 × 1.0375³ = $5,583.86.

Notice what the first year looks like: only $5,000 is available, and the blended return across the whole $25,000 is dragged toward the short end. The ladder is at its weakest right after you build it. It reaches full strength in year five, when every rung has been replaced by a five-year CD and one still matures annually.

If you plan to shop each rung at a different institution rather than stacking them all at one bank, the mechanics of putting offers on a common denominator are covered in [how to compare CD rates across banks](/2026/06/10/how-to-effectively-compare-cd-rates-across-different-banks/).

## Rolling the Ladder: The Only Job You Have Each Year

On each maturity date you have exactly three choices, and picking one takes about ten minutes.

1. **Roll it up.** Open a new CD at the ladder's longest term — five years in the example above. This is the default that keeps the structure intact and pulls the whole ladder toward long-term rates.
2. **Take the cash.** If the money is now needed, take it. That is what the rung was for.
3. **Shorten deliberately.** If you now expect to need cash sooner than the ladder allows, roll into a shorter term instead and accept that the ladder's average maturity drops.

What you must not do is nothing. Doing nothing usually means the bank automatically renews the CD, often into the same term at whatever rate is posted that day. Regulation DD (12 CFR 1030.5) requires advance notice before an automatically renewing CD with a term longer than one year rolls over, so the warning will arrive — but only if the bank has a current address or email for you, and only if you read it. Most ladder failures start here.

## Ladder vs One Long CD vs a Savings Account

Comparing a ladder to a single CD only means something if both are measured over the same horizon with the same reinvestment assumptions. Here is that comparison over five years on the same $25,000, using the assumed opening rates above and three paths for what happens after year one.

Assumptions: maturing rungs roll into new five-year CDs at the reinvestment rate shown; the savings account starts at an assumed 4.00% APY and moves to the same reinvestment rate after year one.

| Rate path after year 1 | Five-rung ladder | Single 5-year CD | High-yield savings |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Flat (reinvest at 3.80%) | $30,110.51 | $30,124.98 | $30,183.02 |
| Falling (reinvest at 2.80%) | $29,535.41 | $30,124.98 | $29,036.60 |
| Rising (reinvest at 4.80%) | $30,696.80 | $30,124.98 | $31,363.06 |

Three things fall out of that table, and none of them are the usual sales pitch.

**The single long CD wins when rates fall.** That is its whole purpose. It is the only column that does not move, and in the falling path it beats the ladder by roughly $590 and the savings account by roughly $1,090. You are paying for that certainty with flexibility.

**The ladder is a compromise, and it prices like one.** In the flat path it trails the single CD by about $14 — effectively a rounding error for a structure that hands you $5,000 every year without a penalty. That $14 is the honest price of the liquidity.

**A savings account can beat both when short rates sit above long rates.** The assumed rate sheet here is inverted: the one-year quote (4.00%) is above the five-year (3.80%). Under that shape, cash that stays liquid does well in flat and rising paths. If your bank's curve slopes the normal way — longer terms paying more — the ranking shifts back toward the CDs. Check the shape of the actual quotes before you decide, and see [short-term vs long-term CDs](/2026/06/08/should-you-opt-for-a-short-term-or-long-term-cd/) for how to read that curve.

## When a Ladder Is the Wrong Tool

Ladders get recommended reflexively. They are a poor fit in several ordinary situations:

- **The money is your emergency fund.** Even the nearest rung is months away, and the rest sits behind penalties. Emergency cash belongs somewhere you can reach the same day.
- **You are confident rates are heading down and you have a fixed horizon.** Then the single long CD is simply better, as the table shows. The ladder's annual reinvestment becomes a liability, not a feature.
- **The balance is too small to split.** Five rungs of $200 each will fail minimum deposit requirements at most institutions and buy you nothing but paperwork.
- **You will not maintain it.** A ladder with three neglected auto-renewals is worse than one CD, because you now hold several mediocre rates instead of one deliberate one.

## Smaller Balances: Mini-Ladders and the Barbell

The five-year, five-rung version is a template, not a rule. Two variations cover most smaller or shorter situations.

**The mini-ladder** compresses the whole structure into a year. Split the deposit across 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month terms so something matures every quarter. It suits money with a known use inside 12 to 18 months — a tax bill, a planned move — where you want more than a savings rate but cannot lock anything up for years.

**The barbell** skips the middle entirely: half in a short term, half at the longest term you're comfortable with, nothing in between. It gives you a near-term exit and a locked long rate without the bookkeeping of five separate maturities. The cost is that you have no rung maturing in years two through four, so a mid-horizon need still means a penalty.

For choosing which specific offers fill each rung, the nine contract terms that decide what you actually keep are laid out in [how to choose a CD](/2026/07/08/how-to-choose-the-best-certificate-of-deposit-for-your-savings-goals/).

## Where the Ladder Lives: Taxable Account or IRA

The same ladder behaves differently depending on the wrapper around it.

In a **taxable account**, CD interest is generally taxable in the year it is credited to you, not the year the CD matures. A five-year CD that credits interest annually can produce a tax bill each year even though you have not touched the money. Institutions report the interest to you and to the IRS on Form 1099-INT; the [IRS guidance on interest income](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403) covers how it is reported and when.

Inside an **IRA CD**, that annual drag disappears — interest is not currently taxed, and the tax treatment depends on the IRA type rather than on the CD. The trade-off is that retirement account withdrawal rules sit on top of the CD's own penalty, so a maturing rung is not simply spendable cash.

The practical rule: ladders built for a spending goal belong in a taxable account, where a maturing rung means money you can use. Ladders built as the conservative sleeve of a retirement account belong in the IRA.

## The Maintenance Calendar You Have to Keep

A ladder fails on dates, not on rates. Write these down when you open each rung.

| Date to record | Where to find it | What you do |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Maturity date | Account disclosure or opening confirmation | Decide: roll up, take cash, or shorten |
| Renewal notice arrival | Mailed or emailed before maturity on longer terms | Read it; it states the new term and rate |
| Grace period end | Stated in the disclosure as a set number of days after maturity | Last day to act without a penalty |
| Interest posting dates | Disclosure or statement | Confirm the interest actually appeared |

The grace period is the part people misjudge. It is a short window after maturity during which you can withdraw or change the CD without a penalty. Banks set the length themselves and state it in the disclosure — find the exact number of days for your CD and put the deadline in a calendar, not in your memory. Once the grace period closes on a renewed CD, you are inside a new term with a new penalty.

## Where Ladders Quietly Fall Apart

**Auto-renewal into the wrong term.** The most common failure. A one-year rung renews into another one-year CD instead of rolling up to five years, and the ladder slowly collapses into a pile of short CDs at unremarkable rates.

**Maturity drift.** Rungs opened on scattered dates, or renewed a few days late, stop being evenly spaced. Within two cycles you have two rungs maturing the same month and an 18-month gap elsewhere. Open rungs on or near the same calendar date each year.

**Rate complacency.** People shop hard for the first five CDs and then renew every rung at the same bank forever. Each maturity is a chance to move the money; check the posted rates and the [FDIC national rate data](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/) — or the [NCUA's share insurance material](https://ncua.gov/consumers/share-insurance-coverage) if you're comparing credit unions — before you renew by default.

**Fee creep and account minimums.** A rung that drops below a minimum balance requirement, or a paper statement charge on five separate accounts, can erase the yield advantage you built the ladder for. Read the fee schedule for every rung, not just the first.

**Ignoring the policy backdrop.** Deposit rates follow funding conditions and the policy environment. You do not need to forecast anything, but skimming the [Federal Reserve's monetary policy page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm) once a quarter tells you whether the next rung should roll long or stay short. The [CFPB's explanation of how CDs work](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd-en-917/) is a good refresher on the contract terms.

## Questions Savers Ask About Ladders

**How many rungs should I use?**
Enough that a maturity lands near each date you might need money, and few enough that you will actually maintain them. Four or five is typical. Ten rungs of $1,000 is usually more administration than the extra flexibility is worth.

**Can I add money to an existing rung?**
Generally no. Standard CDs are closed to additional deposits after funding. Some institutions sell add-on CDs that permit further contributions during the term; if that matters to you, confirm it in the disclosure before opening, not after.

**Do all the rungs have to be at one bank?**
No, and spreading them across institutions lets you take the best rate for each term. It also means separate logins, separate maturity notices, and separate fee schedules. If you spread rungs across banks partly for deposit insurance reasons, verify how coverage applies to your specific account titling rather than assuming.

**What if I need money between maturities?**
You pay the early withdrawal penalty on whichever rung you break, which is why the nearest rung should be sized to your realistic near-term needs. A no-penalty CD used as the shortest rung is one way to build an escape hatch into the structure, usually at a lower rate.

**Is a ladder worth it for $5,000?**
Sometimes — as a mini-ladder with quarterly rungs rather than a five-year structure. Below roughly the point where each rung clears the institution's minimum deposit, you are better off with a single CD or a savings account.

## Building Your First Rung

Decide the longest term you are genuinely willing to commit to, divide your deposit into equal rungs, and open them on the same day so the maturity dates stay clean. Put every maturity date and grace period deadline on a calendar before you fund anything. Then treat each maturity as a fresh decision rather than a formality — that annual decision, not the initial setup, is where a ladder earns its keep.
